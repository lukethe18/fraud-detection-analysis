# Credit Card Fraud Detection Analysis

This project demonstrates an end-to-end fraud analytics workflow, including exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, machine learning modeling, and fraud pattern identification. Built as part of my data science portfolio.

## 🚀 Project Overview
This analysis explores a synthetic credit card transaction dataset to identify patterns of fraudulent behavior. I applied a full machine learning pipeline using:

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Feature engineering (amount deviations, velocity features, distance calculations, time-based flags)
- Handling class imbalance using **SMOTE**
- Logistic Regression baseline model
- Random Forest
- XGBoost
- Model evaluation using ROC, AUC, confusion matrix, feature importance

## 🔧 Tools and Technologies
- Python (pandas, numpy, sklearn, xgboost)
- Matplotlib & Seaborn
- SMOTE (imblearn)
- Jupyter/Colab Notebook

## 📊 Key Results
- Fraud detection improved significantly with engineered features.
- Random Forest outperformed all models:
  - AUC: .8363
  - Accuracy: 98%
  - Precision/Recall (Fraud class): .99 / .98

## 🧠 Notable Feature Engineering
- Amount deviation & Z-scores  
- Transaction velocity (1h, 24h windows)  
- Distance between cardholder and merchant  
- Time-based risk indicators (hour, waking hours)  
- Categorical encoding
